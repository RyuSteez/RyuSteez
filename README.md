ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryu
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, fucking the system, gateway through the matrix and martial arts.

def analyze_problem(problem):
    # Analyze the problem and identify key factors
    print("Analyzing the problem...")

    #  example:
    if "relationship" in problem:
        key_factors.append("Communication")
        key_factors.append("Trust")
    if "career" in problem:
        key_factors.append("Skills")
        key_factors.append("Networking")

    # Add the additional statement
    key_factors.append("Existential perspective: This life  is temporarily for my soul to visit, humanity doesn't elevate")

    return key_factors

            solutions.append("Schedule regular communication sessions")
        if factor == "Trust":

    return solutions
